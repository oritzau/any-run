Currently supported languages:
Python, Javascript (NodeJS), C, C++, Java, Rust

How to use:
run `cargo build --release` to compile into an executable, then 
use `~/path/to/run file_name` to run the desired file in the current directory. 

On linux, I recommend moving run to `~/usr/bin` so it can be used as a global command.

Ex: `run main.py`, `run hello_world.cpp`, `run Calculator.java -e foo`
